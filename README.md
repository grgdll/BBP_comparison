# BBP_comparison

Code used to analyse data from BBP sensors from SBS and RBR.
The main objective is to quantify the variability among sensors from the same manufacturer and between the two manufacturers, when measuring the same water masses.
Ultimately, we aim to avoid introducing step changes in the existing BGC-Argo BBP database due to differences between the RBR-Tridente and SBS-ECO sensors.
