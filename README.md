# BBP_comparison

Code used to analyse data from BBP sensors from SBS and RBR.
The main objective is quantify the inter- and intra-sensor variability when measuring the same water masses.
Ultimately, we aim to avoid introducing step changes in the existing BGC-Argo BBP database due to differences between the RBR-Tridente and SBS-ECO sensors.
